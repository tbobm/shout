# Shout

_When declaring your logs is not enough_

## Usage


```bash
shout -u TIC-DVC4 -p bomberman -s "9:00" -e "12:00 -d declaration.md
```

## Requirements

`shout` expects to have your credentials available as environment variables.
This _could_ change in the future, but it's just the way it is right now.

Please provide the following before attempting to use this utility:

- `ETNA_USER` - Your `login`
- `ETNA_PASS` - The password you use to log in the intranet

## Installation

```bash
pip install --upgrade etna-shout
```

## Example declaration

_Might get autogenerated or something in the future_

```markdown
Objectifs: Achieve something
Actions: Do something
Resultats: Something does foo
```

See [the example directory](./examples/)


## Notice

In case you'd consider this shady in any way, the entirety of the source code is available for you to read.

## Self-promotion

If you want to easily get a list for the `UV` and the `project` flags, etnawrapper allows you to get the list of the current activities by running:

```bash
# implies you propertly set your ETNA_* credentials
$ etna activities list
```
